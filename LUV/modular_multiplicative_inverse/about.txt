(A/B)%M = (A*B^-1)%M

Here B^-1 is the MMI of B.
This MMI of a nubmer can be found out in O(logN) with fermat little theorem

A^(M-1) mod M = 1; where M is prime and A is not a multiple of M

similarly,
A^(M-2) mod M = A^-1; we can find A^(M-2) using binary exponentitaion

This can be useful in permutation and combination problems

Whenever you want to calculate division when modulo is involved
