binary exponentitaion is nothing but a algorithm to calculate a^b. like pow(a,b)

why it is required?
Because of precision errors for large numbers.

Although double data type is able to store very large numbers, but the it is not very precise for large numbers.
pow() function returns a double. So, for very large numbers we might get different results then expected
