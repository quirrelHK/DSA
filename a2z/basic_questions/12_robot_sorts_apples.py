Question 12 
You have a robot which sorts apples in ascending order based on their size. The robot only picks 
apples of different colours (red and green) two at a time. Return “YES” if robot can sort the apples 
else return “NO”. 
 
Example 1 
Input: 6 
26 56 75 3 56 5 
0 1 0 0 0 1 
 
Output: NO 
 
Explanation: The number of red and green apples is not equal. So, the robot will not be able to sort. 
Hence the output returned will be “NO”.
